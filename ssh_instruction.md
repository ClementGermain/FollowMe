# SSH Connection

The raspi is currently plug on my local network. I have redirect all the SSH request of my box on the raspi so we're all able to connect to it from a extern network.   
Here is the bash command :    
  => ssh pi@82.125.7.174
  
If u want to connect from an other application (like putty), the port to use is 22.

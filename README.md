# Concept Project

After shopping, pushing the cart up to the car could be a pain, in particular for disabled or old people. Therefore, we decided to design and develop a product that will simplify the task.

By using our autonomous little cart, one will be able to carry his groceries with ease. The cart will follow the person in the parking, while the obstacle avoidance system will allow to adjust its trajectory on its own in order to avoid obstacles and people. The size of the cart will allow it to carry weight. Your children will be able to enjoy the ride too, as the cart will be able to carry an infant, up to 20 kilos.

Our product will add a good marketing value to supermarkets, and they soon will become key. Our autonomous cart could be used in other situations, such as helping farmers during fruits picking.
